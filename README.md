# Saskatchewan COVID-19 Data
This is a collection of all publicly available case, testing, recovery, hospitalization, fatality and policy data for Saskatchewan during the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.

## Cases
There are two separate files for case data:
### Cases.csv
This file contains the known case data and makes no assumptions, with the exception of some minor regional distribution in March. As very little is shared about each case, this file mostly includes only the region, subregion (if known) and date of each case.
### Aggregate_Cases.csv
Using aggregate data provided daily, each case in this file contains detailed information including sex, age and transmission type. It also contains blank fields for potential future additions to the dataset. However, this data is based on daily aggregates and each individual case involves a high degree of speculation and error. Overall, the aggregate data for each date will be correct but individual cases will not be. Age, sex and transmission type are applied to each days' cases randomly and should not be considered in isolation.
## Fatalities
This file contains detailed information on each fatality collected from news media reports along with provided provincial data.
## Testing
## Recoveries
## Hospitalizations
## Policy
