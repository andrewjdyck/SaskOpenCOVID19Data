# Sask COVID-19 Open Data
This is a collection of all publicly available case, testing, recovery, hospitalization, fatality and policy data for Saskatchewan during the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.

# Case Data
There are two separate files for case data:

## Cases.cxv
This file contains the known case data and makes no assumptions, with the exception of some minor regional distribution in March. As very little is shared about each case, this file mostly includes only the region and date of each case.

## Aggregate_Cases.csv
Using aggregate data provided daily, each case in this file contains detailed information including sex, age and transmission type. However, this data is based on daily aggregates and each individual case involves a high degree of speculation and error. Overall, the data for each date will be correct but its distribution is purely speculative.
